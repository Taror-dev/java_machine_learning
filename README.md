# java machine learning

This project was created to learn Java programming language and machine learning algorithms.

Studied algorithms:

* Backpropagation Algorithm
* Genetic Algorithm

Libraries used:

* Java Springboot
* Thymeleaf
* Google Charts

The project task is to find the function x * sin(x * 10), knowing the input and output values.


Based on the information studied about the Backpropagation algorithm, a library was written (libraries/neural_network).


A genetic algorithm is used to find the working configuration and correct coefficients (alpha, betta, lambda, delta) of the neural network.
